### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** Next.js 16.1.1 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Component-based React architecture, Static site generation

### Current State

**Current Issues Identified from Screenshot:**

1. ❌ **Header Overlap:** The "Projects" page title overlaps with the fixed navigation header
   - Current padding: `pt-20` may be insufficient
   - Hero section starts too close to header
   - Title may be too large or positioned incorrectly

2. ❌ **Button Layout Issues:**
   - Buttons in project cards appear messy and overlap
   - Multiple buttons (GitHub, Demo, Article, Watch Video) may not wrap properly
   - Button spacing may be insufficient
   - Buttons may overflow card boundaries
   - Button sizing may be inconsistent

**Current Implementation:**

1. **`app/projects/page.tsx`**
   - Uses `pt-20` for top padding
   - Hero section with large title
   - May need more top padding or margin

2. **`components/ProjectCard.tsx`**
   - Buttons in flex-wrap layout: `flex flex-wrap gap-3`
   - Multiple button types (GitHub, Demo, Article, Watch Video)
   - Buttons use `size="sm"`
   - May need better spacing and wrapping

---

## 3. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The projects page has two critical layout issues:

1. **Header Overlap:** The fixed navigation header overlaps with the "Projects" page title, making it difficult to read and creating a poor user experience. This is a common issue with fixed headers that requires proper top padding or margin.

2. **Button Layout Problems:** The action buttons (GitHub, Demo, Article, Watch Video) in project cards appear messy, overlap, or don't wrap properly. This creates visual clutter and makes the interface look unprofessional.

These issues significantly impact the user experience and need immediate attention.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Projects page title has proper spacing from fixed header (no overlap)
- [ ] All buttons in project cards are properly spaced and don't overlap
- [ ] Buttons wrap correctly on smaller screens
- [ ] Button layout is clean and organized
- [ ] No visual clutter or overlapping elements
- [ ] Layout works correctly on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Proper spacing throughout the page
- [ ] Professional, polished appearance

### Design Specifications

**Header Overlap Fix:**
- Current: `pt-20` (5rem / 80px)
- Navigation header actual height: 
  - Padding: `py-5 sm:py-6` = 20px/24px top + 20px/24px bottom = 40px/48px
  - Content height: ~30-40px (logo + nav links)
  - Total: ~70-88px depending on screen size
- Issue: Large title (`text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl`) visually appears to overlap even with 80px padding
- Recommended solutions:
  1. **Increase padding:** `pt-24 sm:pt-28` (96px/112px) - provides safe margin
  2. **Add margin to hero:** Add `mt-4 sm:mt-6` to hero section for extra breathing room
  3. **Reduce title size slightly:** Consider `text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl` if overlap persists
  4. **Best approach:** Combine `pt-24` with `mt-4` on hero section for optimal spacing

**Button Layout Fix:**
- Current: `flex flex-wrap gap-3` with `size="sm"` buttons (`px-4 py-2 text-sm`)
- Issues identified:
  1. Cards are in 3-column grid on desktop, making each card narrow (~33% width)
  2. Multiple buttons (GitHub, Demo, Article, Watch Video) compete for space
  3. Buttons may overflow card boundaries or overlap
  4. Gap of `gap-3` (12px) may be insufficient
  5. Buttons need better flex properties to prevent overflow
- Recommended solutions:
  1. **Increase gap:** `gap-3 sm:gap-4` (12px mobile, 16px desktop)
  2. **Better flex properties:** Add `min-w-0 flex-shrink` to buttons to allow proper wrapping
  3. **Responsive button sizing:** Consider even smaller buttons on mobile or in cards
  4. **Button container:** Ensure container has `w-full` and proper overflow handling
  5. **Alternative layout:** Consider vertical stacking on very narrow cards or mobile
  6. **Button text:** Keep button labels short (already done: "GitHub", "Demo", "Article")

**Recommended Solutions:**

1. **Header Overlap (Best Approach):**
   ```tsx
   // In app/projects/page.tsx
   <main id="main-content" className="min-h-screen pt-24 sm:pt-28">
     <section className="flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-16 sm:py-20 mt-4 sm:mt-6">
       {/* Hero content */}
     </section>
   </main>
   ```
   - `pt-24 sm:pt-28` provides 96px/112px top padding (safe margin above header)
   - `mt-4 sm:mt-6` adds extra breathing room between padding and content
   - This ensures large title never visually overlaps

2. **Button Layout (Best Approach):**
   ```tsx
   // In components/ProjectCard.tsx
   <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-3 sm:gap-4 w-full">
     {github && (
       <Button
         variant="primary"
         size="sm"
         href={github}
         external
         className="flex-shrink min-w-0"
       >
         GitHub
       </Button>
     )}
     {/* ... other buttons */}
   </div>
   ```
   - `gap-3 sm:gap-4` provides better spacing (12px mobile, 16px desktop)
   - `w-full` ensures container uses full width
   - `flex-shrink min-w-0` on buttons allows proper wrapping
   - Consider: If buttons still overlap, reduce to `gap-2 sm:gap-3` or use vertical stack on mobile

## 9. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Header Overlap
**Files to modify:**
- [ ] `app/projects/page.tsx`

**Tasks:**
1. Increase top padding from `pt-20` to `pt-24 sm:pt-28` (96px/112px)
2. Add margin to hero section: `mt-4 sm:mt-6` for extra breathing room
3. Test on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
4. Verify large title (`text-4xl` to `text-7xl`) is fully visible below header
5. Check in both light and dark mode
6. Verify spacing looks natural and not excessive

### Phase 2: Fix Button Layout
**Files to modify:**
- [ ] `components/ProjectCard.tsx`

**Tasks:**
1. Review current button layout implementation in ProjectCard
2. Increase gap: Change `gap-3` to `gap-3 sm:gap-4` (12px mobile, 16px desktop)
3. Add `w-full` to button container to ensure proper width
4. Add `flex-shrink min-w-0` classes to Button components (may need to update Button component or add via className)
5. Test with various button combinations:
   - Single button (GitHub only)
   - Two buttons (GitHub + Demo)
   - Three buttons (GitHub + Demo + Article)
   - Four buttons (GitHub + Demo + Article + Watch Video)
6. Test in grid layout (1, 2, 3 columns) to ensure buttons work in narrow cards
7. Verify buttons wrap properly and don't overflow card boundaries
8. If issues persist, consider:
   - Reducing gap further: `gap-2 sm:gap-3`
   - Vertical stacking on mobile: `flex-col sm:flex-row`
   - Smaller button size or custom sizing for project cards

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement
**Tasks:**
1. Test on multiple browsers
2. Test responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
3. Test with various project configurations (different numbers of buttons)
4. Verify no overlap issues
5. Check dark mode appearance
6. Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, focus states)
7. Make final adjustments

## 15. Specific Fixes Required

### Issue 1: Header Overlap
**Problem:** "Projects" title (large text: `text-4xl` to `text-7xl`) visually overlaps with fixed navigation header

**Root Cause:**
- Header height: ~70-88px (varies by screen size)
- Current padding: `pt-20` = 80px (barely sufficient)
- Large title size makes overlap more apparent

**Solution:**
- Increase padding: `pt-20` → `pt-24 sm:pt-28` (96px/112px)
- Add margin to hero: `mt-4 sm:mt-6` for extra breathing room
- This provides safe margin: 96-112px padding + 16-24px margin = 112-136px total clearance
- Ensures large title never visually overlaps header

### Issue 2: Button Overlap
**Problem:** Buttons in project cards overlap and look messy, especially in 3-column grid layout

**Root Cause:**
- Cards are narrow in 3-column grid (~33% width on desktop)
- Multiple buttons (up to 4: GitHub, Demo, Article, Watch Video) compete for space
- Current gap (`gap-3` = 12px) may be insufficient
- Buttons may not wrap properly or overflow card boundaries

**Solution:**
- Increase gap: `gap-3` → `gap-3 sm:gap-4` (12px mobile, 16px desktop)
- Add `w-full` to button container
- Add flex properties to buttons: `flex-shrink min-w-0` (via className prop)
- Test thoroughly with all button combinations
- If still overlapping, consider:
  - Further reduce gap: `gap-2 sm:gap-3`
  - Vertical stack on mobile: `flex-col sm:flex-row`
  - Smaller button size for project cards specifically
