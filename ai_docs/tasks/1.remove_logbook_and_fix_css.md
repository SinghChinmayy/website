e__# AI Task Planning Template - Starter Framework

> **About This Template:** This is a systematic framework for planning and executing technical projects with AI assistance. Use this structure to break down complex features, improvements, or fixes into manageable, trackable tasks that AI agents can execute effectively.

---

## 📋 File Naming Conventione

### Naming Rules
When creating a new task file from this template, follow these naming conventions:

1. **Check Existing Files:** Before creating a new task file, check the `ai_docs/tasks/` folder to find the highest serial number currently in use.

2. **File Naming Format:** Use the format `N.<what_is_this_task_about>.md` where **N** is the next sequential number (incremented for each new task), and `<what_is_this_task_about>` is a concise, underscored description of the main goal of the task.
   - Example: `1.fix_dark_mode.md`, `2.modify_css.md`, etc.

3. **File Location:** All task files must be placed in the `ai_docs/tasks/` folder.

4. **Serial Numbering:** 
   - Do NOT use generic names like `task_1.md`, `task_2.md`, etc.
   - Always use the format above, incrementing N to the next highest task number present in the folder.
   - If no task files exist, start with `1.<what_is_this_task_about>.md`.

**Example Workflow:**
- Check `ai_docs/tasks/` folder → Find `1.fix_routing.md` and `2.setup_db.md` exist
- Next file should be named with an appropriate description and incremented number, such as: `3.add_auth_flow.md`
- Save the new file as: `ai_docs/tasks/3.add_auth_flow.md`

## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Remove My Logbook Page and Components, Fix CSS for Clean Professional Look

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** Remove all logbook/log-related functionality from the site (including the `/logs` page, `LatestLogs` component on homepage, and all log-related components), and comprehensively review and fix CSS styling across all pages to ensure a clean, professional, and consistent design throughout the entire site.

---

## 2. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** Next.js 16.1.1, React 19.2.3, TypeScript 5
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database & ORM:** N/A (static site with markdown files)
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion 12.25.0 for animations
- **Authentication:** N/A
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Static site generation, component-based architecture, markdown-based content management

### Current State
The site currently has:
- A `/logs` page (`app/logs/page.tsx`) displaying all engineering logs
- A `LatestLogs` component on the homepage showing the 5 most recent logs
- Three log-related components: `LatestLogs.tsx`, `LogList.tsx`, and `LogEntry.tsx`
- Log-related imports and dependencies in `app/page.tsx` and `lib/logs.ts`
- Navigation does NOT currently link to logs (good - no changes needed there)
- CSS styling exists but may need refinement for consistency and professional appearance across all pages

**Files to Remove:**
- `app/logs/page.tsx` (entire page)
- `components/LatestLogs.tsx`
- `components/LogList.tsx`
- `components/LogEntry.tsx`

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Remove `LatestLogs` import and usage
- `lib/logs.ts` - Can be kept (may be used elsewhere) or removed if not needed

**CSS Review Areas:**
- Global styles in `app/globals.css`
- Component-level styling in all remaining components
- Consistency in spacing, typography, colors, and responsive design
- Professional polish: hover states, transitions, focus states, accessibility

## 3. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The site currently includes a "My Logbook" feature that is no longer needed. The logbook page and all related components should be completely removed to simplify the site. Additionally, the CSS styling across the site needs to be reviewed and refined to ensure a clean, professional, and consistent appearance. This includes:
1. Removing all logbook-related code and components
2. Ensuring no broken imports or references remain
3. Reviewing and improving CSS for consistency, spacing, typography, and visual polish
4. Ensuring all pages maintain a cohesive design language

### Success Criteria
- [x] `/logs` page is completely removed
- [x] All log-related components (`LatestLogs`, `LogList`, `LogEntry`) are removed
- [x] Homepage no longer imports or displays log-related content
- [x] No broken imports or TypeScript errors after removal
- [x] All pages have consistent, clean, and professional CSS styling
- [x] Typography, spacing, and color schemes are consistent across all pages
- [x] Responsive design works well on all screen sizes
- [x] Hover states, transitions, and focus states are polished and consistent
- [x] Site maintains accessibility standards (ARIA labels, focus indicators, etc.)

## 4. Development Mode Context

### Development Mode Context
- **🚨 Project Stage:** Production-ready portfolio site
- **Breaking Changes:** Acceptable - removing logbook is intentional
- **Data Handling:** Log data files in `data/logs/` can remain (not used by site anymore) or be removed - user preference
- **User Base:** Portfolio site visitors
- **Priority:** Quality and consistency over speed - ensure professional appearance

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Site should function normally without any logbook-related features
- All existing pages (Home, Projects, Contact) should continue to work
- Navigation should remain functional

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** No performance degradation from CSS changes
- **Security:** No security concerns (static site)
- **Usability:** Clean, intuitive, professional appearance
- **Responsive Design:** Must work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Theme Support:** Dark mode must continue to work correctly with improved styling
- **Accessibility:** WCAG compliance maintained, focus states visible, semantic HTML preserved

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain Next.js 16.1.1 compatibility
- Must use existing Tailwind CSS 4 setup
- Must preserve Framer Motion animations where appropriate

## 13. Second-Order Impact Analysis

### Impact Assessment
**Potential Breaking Changes:**
- Removing log components should not break anything if imports are properly cleaned up
- Need to verify no other parts of the codebase reference log components

**Performance Concerns:**
- Removing unused components may slightly improve bundle size
- CSS improvements should not negatively impact performance

**User Workflow Impacts:**
- Users will no longer see logbook content on homepage
- `/logs` route will 404 (expected behavior)
- All other functionality should remain unchanged

**Areas of Concern:**
- Ensure `lib/logs.ts` is not imported anywhere else before considering removal
- Check if any external links point to `/logs` page (may need redirect or 404 handling)
- Verify navigation doesn't have any log-related links (already confirmed - Navigation.tsx doesn't have logs link)

**Testing Checklist:**
- [x] Homepage loads without errors
- [x] Projects page works correctly
- [x] Contact page works correctly
- [x] Navigation works on all pages
- [x] Footer works correctly
- [x] Dark mode toggles correctly
- [x] Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [x] No console errors
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] All links work correctly
- [x] Focus states visible and functional
- [x] Visual consistency across all pages
