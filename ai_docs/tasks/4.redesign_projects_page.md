## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Redesign Projects Page with Simple, Elegant Industry-Standard Layout

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** Completely rewrite and redesign the projects page to create a simple, elegant, and modern portfolio showcase that follows industry best practices.

## 2. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** Next.js 16.1.1 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Component-based React architecture, Static site generation

### Current State

**Current Projects Page Components:**

1. **`app/projects/page.tsx`** - Main page component
   - Hero section with title and description
   - Uses ProjectList component

2. **`components/ProjectList.tsx`** - Container component
   - Simple vertical list layout
   - Basic spacing with gap-8

3. **`components/ProjectCard.tsx`** - Individual project card
   - Single column layout
   - Border-based card design
   - Contains: image, title, description, tech stack, YouTube embed, links, date

**Current Issues Identified:**
1. ❌ **Layout:** Single column vertical stack may feel cramped or unorganized
2. ❌ **Card Design:** Border-based cards may look dated or heavy
3. ❌ **Visual Hierarchy:** All projects treated equally, no emphasis on featured projects
4. ❌ **Spacing:** May lack breathing room and visual rhythm
5. ❌ **Typography:** Could be more refined and elegant
6. ❌ **Grid System:** No grid layout for better organization
7. ❌ **Empty States:** Basic empty state design
8. ❌ **Image Presentation:** Images may not be optimally displayed
9. ❌ **Tech Stack Display:** Tech badges may be too prominent or cluttered
10. ❌ **Overall Polish:** Missing subtle shadows, refined spacing, and modern aesthetics

## 3. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The current projects page, while functional, lacks the visual elegance and simplicity expected in modern portfolio websites. The design appears cluttered and doesn't follow industry standards for showcasing work. Issues include:
1. Lack of visual hierarchy and organization
2. Card design that feels heavy or dated
3. Insufficient spacing and breathing room
4. No grid system for better layout organization
5. Typography and spacing that could be more refined
6. Overall lack of modern, minimal aesthetic

This results in a projects page that doesn't effectively showcase work and fails to create a strong professional impression.
